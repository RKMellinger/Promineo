Class notes
DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself
Boolean - True/false, yes/no, up/down, 0/1, etc. it is a 2 answer operation.

% - Modu
== - Equal to
>= - Greater than
<= - Less than

&& - And, used in a statement, If 5 == 5 && 3 is >= 2.
|| - Or, also used in the same mannor as || except it equals and 'or" function.

If - is a function which runs an if statement and can be chained to multiple outcomes ending in an 		"Else if".
Switch - Is similar to If, used to evaluate a variable and then provide multiple different code 		blocks that could be executed based on the value of the variable. These will use a "Break" 		to finish the code.

Loop - Created a code which will repeat code to a scheduled stop point. (Add 4 cups to a bowl - Add 	1, add 1, add 1, add 1)

for - is a loop funtion, for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
				console.log (i) 
				}
	This will create a counting patern which will stop at 9 as 10 would stop the code.
for (in) - An array which will run with previous information 'Index' (List position)

for (of) - An array which will run with previous information 'Data' (Names on the list)

while - creates a looping patern which may not have a specific stop point and is more flexable as 		to it's applicatioin. Be causious, as it can create an infinate loop, which can cause 		crashs or other errors. 

do - will run at least one process, while and if will not run if the conditions are not met, Do 		will process and show one result minimum.	

User Input- 

window. - will create a window. var name = window.prompt('What is your name?');

prompt - will create a prompt window. var username = prompt('Username:');

alert - will create an alert window. var password = prompt('Password:');

What are the different loops JavaScript provides us with?

"JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

Answers:

What are the different loops JavaScript provides us with?

Javascript provides multiple loop functions. The "For" loop will run a block of code as long as the condition is a "False" value while comparing multiple expressions. The "For/in loops will iterate for specific values and data for an object or listing. The "For/of" loop will create a loop running through iterable objects like "Arrays" and other user-defined objects. "While" statements will run in a loop as long as the condition is in a "true" value. The "Do/while" statement will run minimum of one time until the specified conditions return false.

What is the syntax of one of the loops in your above answer? How and when should you use this loop? Give an example.

The "do/while' syntax: 
let i = 1
do { 
  i = i + 2;
} while (i <= 100); 
console.log(i); 

The statement is a looping code used when the results are needed before the loop runs, like a control sample. Confirming the start point is what was entered into the code prior to running. So the above example will run one time (i = 1) then run untill it is no longer less than 100. The result is 1+2=3, 3+2=5, etc until the sum reaches 101. An great example would be tv, You turn on say Netflix and it shows a trending show, but you don't want to watch that show (uninterested, bored, mood, whatever), that would be the first run of a do/while which resulted false. You scroll through 5 more shows before finding the one you want to watch which then results as True. So it should be:

let i = 1
let uninterestingShow = 10 
do {
 i = i + 1;
} while (i <= uninterestingShow);
console.log(i)

This would equate to "i" scrolled through 11 shows until I found an interesting show.
