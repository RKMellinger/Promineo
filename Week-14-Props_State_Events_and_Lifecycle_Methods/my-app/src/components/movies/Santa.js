              Martian ruler Kimar (Leonard Hicks) is upset that the children of
              Mars are lazy and under the influence of too much pop culture from
              Earth. They are obsessed with the planet's television programs and
              don't want to do much of anything. In an attempt to get the kids
              peppy again, Kimar orders the kidnapping of Santa Claus (John
              Call), hoping that the jolly old toymaker will know how to cheer
              the children up again. But two Earth children are also nabbed, and
              this complicates things for Kimar.
