      <!-- Using an online API of your choice (or if no API can be found, using an
      array for in-memory storage is okay as well), create a React project of
      your choice. You will be working on this for the next three weeks. 
      
      • Project must meet the following criteria: 
        • Use React Router and have at least 3 pages using React Bootstrap 
        or an alternative styling library. 
        • Contain at least 10 components • Allow for all CRUD operations. -->

      >General blueprint of plan:
      <!-- Refactor the various Restaurant app pages from previous assignments. 

        1. Landing page with general information on Milliways. 

        2. Re-factor the comments page (week10) Data is pulled from mockAPI 
          (create script with what ever} -  add only comments will eventualy 
          add edit. 

        3. Re-factor the reservations page(week12). Will use full crud operation. 
          create, read, update, delete Using browser router. 
          
          General concepts:

      Main landing page - The nav bar will have access to all 3 pages. 
        If time permits, add local time clock and timer for "next show" on page. 
        {use reactrouter.com/en/main/start} Landing page is basic/generic restaurant
        landing page. Picture of space cafe as the main background, little blurb 
        about it If there is time, add clock and timer for "next show time" and links 
        to the other pages. If time, attempt to learn and use css to create logo. 

      The comments page - {Like a blog} reads and creates a post with api. -If time, 
        make delete and update. 
      
      The Reservations page - Page will be full crud from start. {Make multi page functions
        for fetching data? Might be easier to call on other pages Create page, read page, 
        etc..} The reservation will take name, party number, dropdown seating request. id
        will be assigned/relayed by the api. Can probably reuse the current
        mockAPI reservation link.  -->
