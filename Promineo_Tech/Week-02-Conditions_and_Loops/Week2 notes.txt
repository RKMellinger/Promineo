Class notes
DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself
Boolean - True/false, yes/no, up/down, 0/1, etc. it is a 2 answer operation.

% - Modu
== - Equal to
>= - Greater than
<= - Less than

&& - And, used in a statement, If 5 == 5 && 3 is >= 2.
|| - Or, also used in the same mannor as || except it equals and 'or" function.

If - is a function which runs an if statement and can be chained to multiple outcomes ending in an 		"Else if".
Switch - Is similar to If, used to evaluate a variable and then provide multiple different code 		blocks that could be executed based on the value of the variable. These will use a "Break" 		to finish the code.

Loop - Created a code which will repeat code to a scheduled stop point. (Add 4 cups to a bowl - Add 	1, add 1, add 1, add 1)

for - is a loop funtion, for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
				console.log (i) 
				}
	This will create a counting patern which will stop at 9 as 10 would stop the code.
for (in) - An array which will run with previous information 'Index' (List position)

for (of) - An array which will run with previous information 'Data' (Names on the list)

while - creates a looping patern which may not have a specific stop point and is more flexable as 		to it's applicatioin. Be causious, as it can create an infinate loop, which can cause 		crashs or other errors. 

do - will run at least one process, while and if will not run if the conditions are not met, Do 		will process and show one result minimum.	

User Input- 

window. - will create a window. var name = window.prompt('What is your name?');

prompt - will create a prompt window. var username = prompt('Username:');

alert - will create an alert window. var password = prompt('Password:');
