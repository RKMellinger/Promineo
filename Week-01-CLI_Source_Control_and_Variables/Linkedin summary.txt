career shift/pivot



troubleshooting


As a Las Vegas local, I've spent the last 15 years as a technician, installing and troubleshooting electronic gaming devices and thier associated networks. During this time I was also sent to various jurisdictions across the country to assist and instruct local technicians on how to troubleshoot new equipment. Ihave also assisted with global order management as an order auditor ensuring outbound orders were processed correctly and creating training documentation to reduce order errors. Prior to that I was an aviation mechanic with the Marine Corps. building and troubleshooting aircraft engines and their components.

During the last few years I have been looking to pivot my career to more of an engineering level and now I am learning software development. My current goal is to be a Frontend developer and eventually learning to be a Full Stack later on in my new career. I look forward to being able to understand the coding process.

Well, after 15 years in gaming I'm finally and officially on the road to pivoting my career. Just started my week 1 of Frontend development at @promineo with JavaScrypt and so far so good. Thank you
