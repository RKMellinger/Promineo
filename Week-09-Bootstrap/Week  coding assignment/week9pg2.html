                                Mountains. The town ran for a few years between 1907 through 1909 during which time the
                                town had multiple hotels, 2 general stores, a book and cigar store, real-estate office,
                                lumberyards, 8 saloons, a candy store, post office, and a brothel. The town continued
                                until around 1915 when the post officce closed and most of the buisness district burned
                                down. The original mine officially shut down around 1918.
