For those of you who use windows and want to follow the Git and Github Quick 
Tutorial in the end orientation section. At the 4 minute mark to create a file 
you're going to use " echo > testfile.js " instead of "touch" to create files 
in command prompt.

Also if you don't have Microsoft office to use Word or Excel for the assignments, 
id recommend to use Google Docs or Google sheets. Not sure if the heads of the 
class have any other options they would prefer to recommend.
