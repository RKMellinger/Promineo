    <h2>Captain Charlotte McBadger-Martogg</h2>

    This no-nonsense Captain is as organized as she is unpredictable. She has many faces depending <br>
    on the situation, <br>
    <ul> <li>When everything goes according to plan, she is the kindest captain you could wish for.</li>
        <li>If she gets too merry in the merry making, then the meaning of her McBadger clan saying
