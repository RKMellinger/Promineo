Refactor the Restaurant app pages.

1. Landing page with general information on Milliways.

2. Re-factor the comments page (week10) is pulled from mockAPI (create script with what ever} - eventualy add only comments.

3. Re-factor the reservations page(week12). Use full crud operation. create, read, update, delete

Using browser router, Open main landing page first. The nav bar will have access to all 3 pages. If time permits, add local time clock and timer for "next show" on page. 
 {use reactrouter.com/en/main/start}

Landing page is basic/generic restaurant landing page. Picture of space cafe as the main, little blurb about it and links to the other pages. 

The comments page {Like a blog} reads and creates a post with api. -If time, make delete and update.

The Reservations page will be full crud from start. {Make multi page functions for fetching data? Might be easier to call on other pages.} The reservation will take name, party number, dropdown seating request. id will be assigned/relayed by the api. Can probably reuse the current mockAPI reservation link.


If time, attempt to learn and use css to create logo.


function App(){
return (
<BrowserRouter>
<Header/> // Create a header function and insert it here.
<main>
<Routes>
<Route path="*" element={<Home/>}/>
<Route path="Comments" element={<Comments/>}/>
<Route path="Reservations" element={<Reservations/>}/>
</Routes>
</main>
</BrowserRouter>
)}
