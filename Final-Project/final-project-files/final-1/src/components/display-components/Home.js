                  Our restaurant is built on the fragmented remains of a long
                  forgotten planet which is enclosed in a vast time bubble and
                  projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of
                  the Universe. Many said this would be impossible but here we
                  are. Shaped like a giant star, you can find the parking
                  garage, bars, and many of the other facilities in the outter
                  points but you'll want to be front and center in ourmain
                  eating area situated in the domed heart for the spectacular
                  views of the End of the universe!
